  excerpt: "Expanding tinyML education into primary and secondary schools (K-12) requires the development of an end-to-end pipeline that is appropriate for school-aged children. We are working with education and industry partners to combine computer science education software and the physical computing ecosystem to enable an easy learning experience for creating, deploying, and using tinyML models. This pipeline will enable the creation of additional materials that can be used across the globe for students of all ages."
