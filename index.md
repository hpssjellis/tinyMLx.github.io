excerpt: "We are an international group of academics and industry professionals working to improve global access to educational materials for the cutting-edge field of TinyML. TinyML brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to the performance- and power-constrained domain of embedded systems. Successful deployment in this field requires knowledge of applications, algorithms, hardware, and software. TinyMLedu is hosted by the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and affiliated with the TinyML foundation."

The [SciTinyML: Scientific Use of Machine Learning on Low-Power Devices](http://indico.ictp.it/event/9622/) workshop hosted by the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) has been postponded to **October 18-22 2021** due to the global semiconductor shortage as a result of COVID-19. [View the updated flyer](/assets/images/4D/2021ICTPWorkshop.png). 

In the meantime, we will be holding three introductory seminars for the TinyML4D Academic Network on:
+ **September 17, 1-2pm GMT**: Academic Network Introduction and Why the Future of ML is Tiny and Bright with [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://scholar.harvard.edu/vijay-janapa-reddi/home) of Harvard University. [Vijay's slides](/assets/slides/4D/seminars/21.09.17_Vijay_Janapa_Reddi.pdf). [Full Seminar Video](https://youtu.be/LeW9lsyNqgY).
+ **October 1, 1-2pm GMT**: Software Tools for TinyML with [Prof. Marcelo Rovai](https://github.com/Mjrovai) of Universidade Federal de Itajubá. [Marcelo's Slides](/assets/slides/4D/seminars/21.10.01_Marcelo_Rovai.pdf). [Full Seminar Video](https://youtu.be/aV_e1wFjK8s). [Chat Log](/4D/AcademicNetwork/21-10-01-SeminarChatLog).
+ **October 8, 1-2pm GMT**: Case Studies of TinyML in Rwanda and Brazil and Academic Network AMA

We have posted [all the materials](https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware/tree/master/edX) from the [edX specialization](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-tiny-machine-learning) as well as our custom [Arduino Library](https://github.com/tinyMLx/arduino-library) and all supporting [Colab Notebooks](https://github.com/tinyMLx/colabs). All of the materials are open source licensed and are at most [non-commercial share alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) – which means just cite us and you can use it all for free! You can also find materials from other TinyML courses and workshops that have been developed in the table below.

We are also trying to track and provide links to others to all TinyML course materials that are created to make it even easier for others to launch courses so we ask that if you create a course based on these materials that you consider posting your materials publicly and sending us a link so we can add it to the table below.

Questions, comments, concerns, suggestions for improvement – reach out to us at {% include email %}!
