excerpt: "The TinyML4D working group is building a network of academic institutions, based in Developing Countries, interested in expanding access to Applied Machine Learning by establishing best practices in education. We aim to ultimately develop a community of researchers and practitioners focused on both improving access to TinyML education and enabling innovative solutions for the unique challenges faced by Developing Countries."

{% include feature_row id="network_map" type="left" %}

**Network activities include**:
+ Joint workshops and seminars on TinyML with lab sessions hosted by and for network members
+ An online forum to consolidate the TinyML community of researchers, educators, and practitioners
+ Exchange of student projects, lesson plans, real-world deployments and outreach materials

With support from our [sponsors](/sponsors), member universities are receiving Arduino Tiny Machine Learning Kits for free which they can use for the hands-on lab components of the specialization and for further exploration of the opportunities and challenges of deploying and testing their own TinyML projects.

If you would like to be a part of the network reach out to us at {% include email %}!

The [SciTinyML: Scientific Use of Machine Learning on Low-Power Devices](http://indico.ictp.it/event/9622/) workshop hosted by the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) has been postponded to *October 18-22 2021* due to the global semiconductor shortage as a result of COVID-19. [View the updated flyer](/assets/images/4D/2021ICTPWorkshop.png). In the meantime, we will be holding three introductory Zoom meetings for the Academic Network on:
+ *September 17*: Academic Network Introduction and Why the Future of ML is Tiny and Bright with [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://scholar.harvard.edu/vijay-janapa-reddi/home) of Harvard University
+ *October 1*: Software Tools for TinyML with [Prof. Marcelo Rovai](https://github.com/Mjrovai) of Universidade Federal de Itajubá
+ *October 8*: Case Studies of TinyML in Rwanda and Brazil and Academic Network AMA

**If you are a member of the Academic Network make sure to join our Discord – the invite link should be in your email!**
