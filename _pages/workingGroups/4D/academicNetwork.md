excerpt: "The tinyML4D working group is building a network of academic institutions, based in Developing Countries, interested in expanding access to Applied Machine Learning by establishing best practices in education. We aim to ultimately develop a community of researchers and practitioners focused on both improving access to tinyML education and enabling innovative solutions for the unique challenges faced by Developing Countries."

{% include feature_row id="network_map" type="left" %}

**Network activities include**:
+ Joint workshops and seminars on tinyML with lab sessions hosted by and for network members
+ An online forum to consolidate the tinyML community of researchers, educators, and practitioners
+ Exchange of student projects, lesson plans, real-world deployments and outreach materials

With support from our [sponsors](/sponsors), member universities are receiving Arduino Tiny Machine Learning Kits for free which they can use for the hands-on lab components of the specialization and for further exploration of the opportunities and challenges of deploying and testing their own tinyML projects.

To learn more about our past seminars, workshops, and other events, please view our [past events](/4D/pastEvents) page.
