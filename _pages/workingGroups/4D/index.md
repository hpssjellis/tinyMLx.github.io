The [SciTinyML: Scientific Use of Machine Learning on Low-Power Devices](http://indico.ictp.it/event/9622/) workshop hosted by the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) has been postponded to *October 18-22 2021* due to the global semiconductor shortage as a result of COVID-19. [View the updated flyer](/assets/images/4D/2021ICTPWorkshop.png). In the meantime, we will be holding three introductory seminars for the Academic Network on:
+ *September 17*: Academic Network Introduction and Why the Future of ML is Tiny and Bright with [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://scholar.harvard.edu/vijay-janapa-reddi/home) of Harvard University. [Vijay's slides](/assets/slides/4D/seminars/21.09.17_Vijay_Janapa_Reddi.pdf). [Full Seminar Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In3ZgBBBLKw).
+ *October 1*: Software Tools for TinyML with [Prof. Marcelo Rovai](https://github.com/Mjrovai) of Universidade Federal de Itajubá
