We are working to collect materials from all courses that teach TinyML to create an easy to access repository of course modules, readings, slides, assignments, etc. 
The workshop details can be found at [this link](http://indico.ictp.it/event/9622/)
**You can find our central repository [at this link](https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware).**
