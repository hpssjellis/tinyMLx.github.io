The [SciTinyML: Scientific Use of Machine Learning on Low-Power Devices](http://indico.ictp.it/event/9622/) workshop hosted by the [Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) has been postponded to **October 18-22 2021** due to the global semiconductor shortage as a result of COVID-19. In the meantime, we will be holding three introductory Zoom meetings for the Academic Network on:
+ **September 17**: Academic Network Introduction and Why the Future of ML is Tiny and Bright with [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://scholar.harvard.edu/vijay-janapa-reddi/home) of Harvard University
+ **October 1**: Software Tools for TinyML with [Prof. Marcelo Rovai](https://github.com/Mjrovai) of Universidade Federal de Itajubá
+ **October 8**: Case Studies of TinyML in Rwanda and Brazil and Academic Network AMA

**If you are a member of the Academic Network make sure to join our Discord – the invite link should be in your email!**
