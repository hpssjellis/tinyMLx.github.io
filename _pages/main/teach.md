excerpt: "TinyML can be used to teach a whole host of topics (e.g., software engineering, machine learning, embedded systems) at varying levels of prior knowledge. We want to help you design and teach your own TinyML course. To that end we've launched a couple of exciting projects you can find below to help build a community and resources for teaching all kinds of TinyML courses."
