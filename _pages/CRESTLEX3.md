*Are you curious about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to improve your everyday life? Do you ever wonder how your cell phone understands and responds to a question that you ask it? Have you heard the term Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Machine Learning (ML), but aren’t sure about possible uses of ML or AI, or how you might prepare for a career in this field?*

![Students workign on computer hardware projects](/assets/images/crestlex/students.jpg){:style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 7px; width: 225px;"}
This first-of-its-kind, 1-week, hands-on/virtual course for high school teachers and students will give you experience in developing a real-world application of ML through hands-on examples of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to small low-power computing devices. This course will expose participants to the applications, algorithms, hardware, and software of TinyML.

Participants will be given an [Arduino Tiny Machine Learning Kit](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/tiny-machine-learning-kit) which they will use for hands-on exploration of the opportunities and challenges of TinyML by deploying and testing their own TinyML models. Following the completion of the course, students will be well positioned to excel in the [HarvardX Professional Certificate Program in Tiny Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-tiny-machine-learning), a free online MOOC that dives deeper into the world of Tiny Machine Learning with more hands on experiences.

This program is a collaboration between Navajo Technical University, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Google, and will be run virtually from June 22 to June 25, 2021. We will be accepting up to 50 students and teachers. Deadline to apply is May 15, 2021. We look forward to exploring TinyML with you this summer.
