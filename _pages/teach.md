excerpt: "TinyML can be used to teach a whole host of topics (e.g., software engineering, machine learning, embedded systems) at varying levels of prior knowledge. We want to help you design and teach your own TinyML course. To that end we've launched a couple of exciting projects you can find below to help build a community and resources for teaching all kinds of TinyML courses."

We have posted [all the materials](https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware/tree/master/edX) from the [edX specialization](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-tiny-machine-learning) as well as our custom [Arduino Library](https://github.com/tinyMLx/arduino-library) and all supporting [Colab Notebooks](https://github.com/tinyMLx/colabs). All of the materials are open source licensed and are at most [non-commercial share alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) – which means just cite us and you can use it all for free! You can also find materials from other TinyML courses and workshops that have been developed in the table below.

We are also trying to track and provide links to others to all TinyML course materials that are created to make it even easier for others to launch courses so we ask that if you create a course based on these materials that you consider posting your materials publicly and sending us a link so we can add it to the table below.

Finally, if you want to be more involved with our effort to help improve access to TinyML educational materials and hardware resources worldwide please check out the [TinyML4D working group](/TinyML4D/)!
