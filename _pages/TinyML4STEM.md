excerpt: "TinyML can be a great entry point to programming and machine learning for K-12 students. Take a look at our existing course modules and teacher training materials and help join the community effort to develop and improve upon those materials. Together we can get TinyML education into the K-12 classroom."

We are working to collect materials from all courses that teach TinyML to create an easy to access repository of course modules, readings, slides, assignments, etc. 

**You can find our central repository [at this link](https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware).**
